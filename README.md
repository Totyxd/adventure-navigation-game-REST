# Adventure game navigation

- This is a project which had the objective of practicing route handlers with RESTful arquitecture for different endpoints in what would be a navigation adventure game. It uses OOP and the HTTP core-module from node.js to handle requests.

- The main server application is developed but details, such as filling the world with items or more rooms have not been implemented. You can download the project and try adding them yourself if you'd like to. DonÂ´t forget the main purpose of this practice was creating a working server application in the context of game that works with OOP.

- Server.js handles error through redirection tough a more sofistcated and detailed approach could be implemented. Item class is not used but could be used too. The app handles dinamyc html with html templating with the replace String method.Project may have some undetected request handling errors but nothing noticeable on first sight.
